            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> My name is Amalia Boomgaard but I have gone by Amy for most of my life.
                I recently graduated UCF's coding bootcamp. When I first began coding I thought I would lean more towards front-end work only as I enjoy designing and watching my designs come to life through the computer screen.
                However now that I have more experience working with the back-end I realize that it was not as hard as I thought it would be.
                I would like to be a Full Stack Developer, either or, React Developer. I enjoy coding and it has been a life changer.
                I enjoy working with React Framework and Javascript. In my freetime you can find me relaxing with a physical or digital sketchbook in hand and my headphones on drawing away. </p>
